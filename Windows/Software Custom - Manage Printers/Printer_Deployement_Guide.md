# Print Managment Solutions

1. Add via Import Printer Config:
    - This solution is useful when you have a pre-configured printer configuration file (e.g., .inf, .dat or .ppd file) that you want to import and use for printer deployment.

2. Add via IP:
    - This solution is useful when you want to add a printer directly by specifying its IP address.

3. Add via Print Server:
    - This solution is useful when you have a print server in your network that manages multiple printers as well as print job authentication.
