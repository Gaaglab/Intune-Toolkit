# Enabling Intune Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to enable and configure Intune Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) to manage local administrator passwords on Windows devices.

## Overview
Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) integrates with Azure AD and Intune to automatically manage local administrator passwords on Windows devices. This ensures security through unique, regularly rotated passwords.

- Enable **Post Authentication Reset Delay**
- **Post Authentication Reset Delay:** `1`

5. Click **Next**.
6. **Assignments:**

   - Example Dynamic Group Query:
     ```plaintext
     (device.deviceOSType -eq "Windows")
     ```
7. **Review and Create:** Confirm settings and create the policy.

## Step 3: Verify LAPS Deployment
1. Navigate to `Devices > All Devices` in the Intune Admin Center.
2. Select a device and go to `Device Configuration > Policies`.
3. Check the compliance status of the **AccountProtection-LAPS** policy.

## Step 4: Retrieve Local Administrator Passwords
1. **Access Azure AD:**
   - Go to `Devices > All Devices` in the Entra Admin Center.
   - Select the target device.
   - Click **Device Passwords** to retrieve the current local admin password.

2. **Via PowerShell:**
   - Use the `Get-LapsAADPassword` cmdlet from the LAPS PowerShell module:
     ```powershell
     Get-LapsAADPassword -DeviceName "DeviceName"
     ```

---

## Best Practices
- **Restrict access** to the Device Passwords pane in Azure AD using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- Regularly review and audit access logs for password retrieval.
- Use conditional access policies to secure admin accounts.

---

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure devices have the latest Windows updates to support LAPS.
- Verify that the `AccountProtection-LAPS` policy is assigned and applied successfully.
- Check for errors in `Event Viewer > Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > LAPS` on target devices.

1. **Policy Not Applying**
   - Ensure that the device is properly enrolled in Intune and that the LAPS policy is assigned to the correct device group.
   - Check the deviceâ€™s sync status and force a policy sync if necessary.

2. **Password Retrieval Issues**
   - Verify that the device has successfully received the LAPS policy and that the password is being stored correctly.
   - Check for any errors or warnings in the `Event Viewer` related to LAPS.
