# Configuring OneDrive Team Site Library Sync and Proactive Remediation

This guide will walk you through setting up a Configuration Profile in Microsoft Intune to automatically sync OneDrive team site libraries and configure Proactive Remediation to manage registry settings for sync delays.

## Before You Begin

Before setting up your Configuration Profile in Intune, gather the SharePoint document library ID(s). For this example, weâ€™ll use the Sales and Marketing departments' library. Follow these steps:

1. **Browse to the SharePoint Library**
   - Navigate to the SharePoint document library you want to sync.

2. **Get the Library ID**
   - Click `Sync`.
   - A window will appear; ignore any prompts to open OneDrive.
   - Click `Copy library ID` and keep this value handy.

   **IMPORTANT**: The copied library ID must be converted from Unicode to ASCII. Open PowerShell and use the following command (replace `"Copied String"` with your copied library ID):

   ```powershell
   [uri]::UnescapeDataString("Copied String")
   ```
# Creating the Configuration Profile

## Open Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center

1. Go to [Microsoft Endpoint Manager Admin Center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/).
2. Sign in with your admin credentials.

## Navigate to Configuration Profiles

1. Click `Devices` > `Configuration profiles`.
2. Click `+ Create profile`.

## Create a New Profile

1. Choose `Windows 10 and later` as the platform.
2. Select `Templates` and then `OneDrive`.
3. Enter a name and description for your profile.

## Configure OneDrive Settings

1. **Select "Configure team site libraries to sync automatically"**:
   - Enable this setting.
   - Enter a name for the library for easy identification.
   - Paste the ASCII-converted library ID from earlier.
   - Add a description if necessary.

2. **Require users to confirm large delete operations**:
   - This setting is not required but recommended to prevent accidental data deletion.

3. **Convert synced team site files to online-only files**:
   - This setting is also recommended but not required.
   - It extends Files-On-Demand technology to synced libraries.

## Deploy the Configuration Profile

1. Assign the profile to your test users before deploying it to production.


# Bonus
**Create a Proactive Remediation Profile (Optional)**

To reduce the 8-hour delay for end-users to see their administratively assigned libraries via the OneDrive sync client, use Proactive Remediations. This will ensure that the necessary registry key is set or verified on a recurring basis.

1. **Navigate to Proactive Remediations**
   - Go to `Reports` > `Endpoint Analytics` > `Proactive Remediations`.
   - Click `+ Create Script Package`.

2. **Name and Describe the Script Package**
   - Enter an appropriate name and description for the script package.

3. **Upload the Detection Script**
   - File in repo [Here](/Windows/Configure%20-%20OneDrive%20(silent%20sync)/DisableSyncDelay_Detection.ps1)

4. **Upload the Remediation Script**
   - File in repo [Here](/Windows/Configure%20-%20OneDrive%20(silent%20sync)/DisableSyncDelay_Remediation.ps1)


5. **Configure Script Settings**
   - Set `Run this script using the logged-on credentials` to `Yes`.
   - Set `Run script in 64-bit PowerShell` to `Yes`.

6. **Set a Schedule**
   - Configure the script to run on a recurring schedule (e.g., every 1 hour).
   - Deploy the script package to the same users or devices as your Configuration Profile.
